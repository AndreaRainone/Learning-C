# Learning-C
C Programming learning path - University of Salerno
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this repository will be uploaded every excercise during my C Programming language learning path.
Why? Why not. Hope this will be helpful for anyone who wants to learn it.
The repository is divided in two parts:

First part: academic path

Second part: more excercises/examples

I'll try to make the codes clear for anyone, even if the tasks are given in italian

+ I will not upload executable files, you can compile the code on your own.
